# FIGS: Feline Image Generation Service

# Stage 1: Idea Refinement

## Example Refined Idea Prompt


Help me generate a refined idea prompt for my AVS idea using [prompts/stage1-idea-refinement-prompt.md] for guidance. 

Operator Work: Design an AVS where a single Operator generates cat images via LLM inference.
Validation: The work is validated using at least two other operators set of LLMs to measure their accuracy. The validating operators should assign a percentage "accuracy rating" between 0% and 100%.
Rewards: validating operators get rewarded if they respond with any accuracy rating. Mark the Operator that generated the original image for a reward if the aversage validator accuracy was greater than 90%


## Output from Claude Code (PASSING)
[Internal note: the output from Claude Code below is considered "PASSING" b/c it enhanced my basic idea prompt]

# Stage 2: Idea Refinement

## Example Design Prompt

Help me generate a design tech spec for my using the attached figs-refined-idea-prompt.md and prompts/stage2-design-generation-prompt.md for guidance. 

## Output from Claude Code

Note: this took about 5 mins for Claude Code to execute. It was not quick, but the results were good.
