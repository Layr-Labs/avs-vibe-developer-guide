# AVS Idea to Design to Prototype Vibe Development Guide

## Overview 
**Why**: this guide is meant to enable the user to go from a raw AVS Idea to Design to Prototype (Code) in under 10 mins and learn more about how EigenLayer works along the way.

**Who**: this guide is written to serve a more technical developer audience that prefers [Vibe Coding](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?lang=en) with popular AI / LLM tools such as [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview). Please note that EigenLayer is also working to release a web app experience to enable the same Idea to Prototype flow which will be released independently.

**Pre-requisites**:

* High level understanding of [EigenLayer protocol](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/overview), [Autonomously Verifiable Services](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/developers/Concepts/avs-developer-guide), and how building an AVS might add value to your Web3 project.   
* Any high level idea you have for an AVS.  
* [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) installed on your machine.

**Caveats:**
- Including Claude Code and Hello-World-AVS in order to deliver a useful MVP
- Excluding Slashing functionality until the AVS Eng team is able to add this functionality to the eigenlayer-middleware / ECDSAServiceManager repo dependency for Hello World.
- For these tools, please limit your idea and designs to focus on the scope of **one [Operator Set](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/concepts/operator-sets/operator-sets-concept)** at at time.
- The files under the `context` folder will soon be replaced with an MCP server.

# Instructions

## Stage 0: Environment Setup

- Open a new terminal session.
- `git clone` a local copy of this repo and `cd` into the newly created `avs-vibe-developer-guide` folder.  
- Run the following command to add the EigenLayer MCP Server to your local `claude` instance:
   ```claude mcp add --transport sse eigenlayer-mcp-server https://eigenlayer-mcp-server-sand.vercel.app/sse``` 
- Run `claude` command to enter the Claude Code console.
- Run `init` command to initialize the repository for Claude Code. 

## Stage 1: Idea Refinement

This stage is focused on taking your high level idea for building an AVS and turning it into a refined idea prompt. This will help reaffirm that your idea can be practically built as an AVS and result in a prompt that will be easy for the LLM to convert into a full AVS Design tech spec.  

In your Claude Code terminal session, send the following prompt:
```markdown
Help me generate a refined idea prompt for my AVS idea using the attached prompts/stage1-idea-refinement-prompt.md file for guidance.

My idea for an AVS is: [insert your idea here].
```

Please note that you may also add any AVS design detail you may already have in mind, including the following context to your prompt:
    * Project Overview: what is the name of your project and what value does it provide for its users?  
    * AVS Purpose: what benefit does the AVS provide to securing, validating or decentralizing your project.  
    * Name: what do you want to name your AVS? Or do you want the LLM to name it for you ðŸ˜‰?  
    * Operator Work: which core work or task will the Operators that comprise your AVS do?  
    * Validation: The work is validated through [todo - insert a description of your validation logic at a high level]  
    * Rewards: send Rewards distributions to Operators based on [todo]

5. The LLM will respond with either feedback on how to improve your AVS idea or a "[avs-name]-refined-idea-prompt.md" for your review.

## Stage 2: Design (Tech Spec) Generation

In your Claude Code terminal session, send the following prompt:
```markdown
Help me generate a design tech spec for my using the attached [myavs-refined-idea-prompt.md] file and prompts/stage2-design-generation-prompt.md file for guidance.
```

3. The LLM will respond with a completed "[avs name]-design-tech-spec.md" file for your review.

## Stage 3: Prototype (Code) Generation

In your Claude Code terminal session, send the following prompt:
```markdown
Help me generate a prototype implementation for my AVS using the attached [my-avs]-design-tech-spec.md file and prompts/stage3-prototype-code-generation-prompt.md file for guidance.
```

3. The LLM will respond with a prototype built in the "hello-[avs name]-world" folder for your review.


# Appendix

## Repo Overview

The `/prompts` folder includes refined prompts to guide the LLM at each stage in content generation for [AVS](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/developers/Concepts/avs-developer-guide) idea, design and prototype (code) generation. 

The `/context` folder includes a collection of content that is helpful to add selective context to the LLM. These assets serve as a simple mechanism to enrich the LLM context window with the right information for a given prompt. These are a simpler, low-tech alternative to integrating an MCP server (which we will probably also build at a later stage).

## Testing

In order to continuously improve the AVS prompts in this repository, we will continue to add new example AVSs in the [test](/test/) folder. We will regenerate these AVSs from Idea to Design to Prototype to measure our improvements of the prompts at each stage.

## Roadmap

1. Enhance our default prompts for each stage. The initial prompts are minimally viable and can easily be improved with more time and iteration.  
2. Design: add automated logo generation and architecture design to the design generation step.  
3. The Prototype code generation phase is focused on [hello-world-avs](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/hello-world-avs) as the target codebase. We will expand this to other examples and partner platforms in the future.  
4. Add a standard front end to the hello-world-avs repo to enable better demo'ing of the solution (pull from [this example](https://x.com/weswfloyd/status/1908267994033353206)).
5. Add Slashing after it has been launched and fully integrated with eigenlayer-middleware/ECDSAServiceManager and hello-world-avs.
